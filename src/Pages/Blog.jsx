                    <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. </p>
                    <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</p>
